# CPSC 231: Introduction to Computer Science
## Assignment 1: Introduction to Python, The Game of Pig
This assignment was my first use of Python, where I implement a version of the game Pig in the console window using python.

### Problem 1: Rolling a die
Write a Python program to simulate a 6 sided die. Print the output to the terminal.
* Input: N/A
* Output: The result of the die roll

### Problem 2: Expected Value
Write a Python program to compute the average outcome of a custom number of simulated rolls.
* Input: The number of simulated rolls
* Output: Average outcome of the dice rolls

### Problem 3: Expected Rolls
Write a Python program to count the number of rolls before a 1 comes up. Then estimate the average number of turns before pigging out using the same method as problem 2.
* Input: The number of simulated turns
* Output: Average number of turns before pigging out

### Problem 4: The Computer's Turn
Write a Python program that simulates a single turn of Pig with the computer using the strategy of rolling greater than 20 points and then holding.
* Input: None
* Output: Print the outcome of each roll, and the final score the computer player gets.

### Problem 5: The Computer's Strategy
Change the strategy of the Computer player such that it holds at 20, or if it has accumulated 100 points and won the game, it stops. 
* Input: The current total score
* Output: Print the outcome of each die roll, and then print the turn score and total score for the computer.

### Problem 6: The Solitaire Pig
Write a program that plays a one player game of pig, starting at a score of 0, and playing each turn until it reaches 100 points.
* Input: None
* Output: Print a transcript of each turn of the computer playing pig until it reaches 100 points


### Problem 7: Computer vs Computer
Write a program that simulates two computer AIs playing Pig against each other.
* Input: None
* Output: Print a transcript of the two computer AIs playing Pig

### Problem 8: Player vs AI
Replace one of the computer players from the previous problem with an interactive prompt for a human player. 
* Input: Each turn ask if the player wants to [r]oll, or [h]old.
* Output: Print a full transcript of the game playing out
